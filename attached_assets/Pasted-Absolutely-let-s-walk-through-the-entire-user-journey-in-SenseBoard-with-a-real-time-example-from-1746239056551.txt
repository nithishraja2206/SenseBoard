Absolutely — let’s walk through the entire user journey in SenseBoard with a real-time example, from start to finish, just like a real user would experience it. This is ideal for showcasing in your portfolio case study to highlight design decisions and flow thinking.

🔵 User Persona
Name: Aria (UI/UX Designer)
 Goal: Designing a landing page for a wellness app. She wants to collect inspiration across formats (visual, sound, thoughts) and track the emotional tone of the project.

✅ 1. Start: Enters SenseBoard
Aria logs into SenseBoard and lands on the Dashboard.
She sees the Mood Canvas: options to add inspiration by type — Sketch, Image, Sound, Thought, Link.


She also sees a Flow Map Overview — a real-time visual of connected inspirations, colored by mood tags like Calm, Energetic, and Focused.



✅ 2. Adds Inspirations
She begins her inspiration-gathering process:
🎨 Adds a Sketch:
Opens the Sketch Pad page.


Draws a wireframe idea for a calming landing page with a breathing animation.


Tags it as: Calm, UX Flow, Low-Fi.


🖼️ Adds an Image:
Uploads a high-res photo of misty mountains from Unsplash.


Tags it as: Visual, Minimal, Nature.


🎵 Adds a Sound:
Uploads a short nature sound loop with forest ambience.


Tags: Ambient, Focus, Mood Booster.


💭 Adds a Thought:
Types: “The user should feel like they’ve walked into a spa.”


Tags: Intent, User Feeling, Core Idea.


🔗 Adds a Link:
Saves a Figma file of a UI kit she’s referencing.


Tags: System, Reference, Structure.



✅ 3. Views Mood Detail
Clicks on the Mountain image in the canvas.


Sees a Mood Detail Page:


Image + sketch + the sound that pairs well with it.


AI Suggests: “Pair this visual with a slow-motion animation.”


Aria makes notes: “Use this as hero section background.”



✅ 4. Builds the Flow Map
Auto-generated Flow Map updates with:


Central Node: Wellness Landing


Branches:


“Hero Mood” → Mountain Image + Sound


“Interaction Vibe” → Sketch + Thought


“Design System” → Figma Link



✅ 5. Final Output / End Result
Aria now has:
A sensory storyboard for her wellness landing page.


Each node in the Flow Map holds inspiration with attached mood/emotion.


She exports:


A visual PDF of the flow map with media embeds.


A moodboard package to share with her team via a link.


Bonus: The team mood aura is 78% “Calm” — meaning they’re aligned emotionally!



✨ Outcome:
Aria’s client presentation is stunning — not just what the design looks like, but what it feels like.
