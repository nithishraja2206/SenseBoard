Aria, a UI/UX designer, logs into SenseBoard to begin working on a landing page for a wellness app. She arrives at the Dashboard, where she sees the Mood Canvas — a space to add inspiration using Sketch, Image, Sound, Thought, and Link — alongside a Flow Map Overview that visualizes emotional states like Calm, Energetic, and Focused. She begins by opening the Sketch Pad and drawing a low-fidelity wireframe of a calm landing page with a slow breathing animation, tagging it as Calm, UX Flow, and Low-Fi. Next, she uploads a high-resolution photo of misty mountains from Unsplash, tagging it as Visual, Minimal, and Nature. To add an auditory element, she uploads a short loop of forest ambience and tags it with Ambient, Focus, and Mood Booster. She then writes a thought — “The user should feel like they’ve walked into a spa” — and tags it with Intent, User Feeling, and Core Idea. Finally, she adds a link to a Figma UI kit she plans to reference, tagging it as System, Reference, and Structure. After gathering her inspirations, Aria clicks on the mountain image in the Mood Canvas to view its details. She’s taken to the Mood Detail View, which shows the image, the linked sketch, and the ambient sound. SenseBoard’s AI assistant suggests pairing the visual with a slow-motion animation, and Aria adds a note: “Use this as hero section background.” Meanwhile, the Flow Map auto-generates, organizing her inspirations into a visual structure with a central node labeled "Wellness Landing Page." Branches form automatically: “Hero Mood” connects the mountain image and sound; “Interaction Vibe” includes the sketch and thought; “Design System” is linked to the UI kit. The Flow Map uses mood-based gradients to convey emotional tone and relationships. Aria exports a PDF of the Flow Map with all inspirations embedded and a moodboard package for team review. SenseBoard shows a team Mood Aura Score of 78% Calm, confirming emotional alignment across collaborators. In her client presentation, Aria doesn’t just showcase static design — she presents an emotional, multisensory narrative of the user experience. The client connects instantly with the vision. The end result is more than a design; it’s a feeling, fully realized through SenseBoard’s sensory-first workflow.
